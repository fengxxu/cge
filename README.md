There are two major steps in CGE. $f$ and $\varphi = \{\Phi, \Psi\}$ denote an NN and a verification specification, where the pair $\Phi $ and $ \Psi$ denote the input and output specifications. $\mathbf{x}_{ce}$ denotes a counterexample generated by the verifier. For our collaborative evaluation, there are $m$ numbers of verification instances and $n$ numbers of verifiers. After step 1, $m'$ instances' are confirmed as ground truths including violations and desirables. Step 2 is to evaluate the soundness and completeness of verifiers by comparing the $m' \times n$ numbers of filtered verification results with ground truths. FN and FP denote false negative and false positive.

## How to run

**Firstly, clone the rep:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fengxxu/cge.git
cd cge
unzip benchmarks.zip
```
**Secondly, create a new environment, or skip to the next step:**

For example, using conda ([How to install](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/))

```bash
conda create --name cge python=3.10
conda activate cge
```

**Thirdly, install the libraries:**

Choice 1: Please note the libraries in the requirements.txt file are used for running the verifiers and CGE, 
```bash
conda install --file requirements.txt
```
Choice 2: for CGE only, run the following commands,
```bash
conda install -c anaconda jupyter
conda install -c anaconda pandas
conda install -c conda-forge onnxruntime
conda install -c anaconda numpy
pip install z3-solver
```
**Lastly, open the main.ipynb, select the correct kernel for the notebook, following instructions in the notebook to replicate the experiment**
